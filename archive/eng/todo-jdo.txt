- stop using PropertyMap as key. switch to serializable String based
  with transient slots for actual thing. add new PMap constructor ?
  another option is to use defined key order and a CompoundKey. might
  want to wait for metamodel changes, which will provide similar

- reverse navigation in jdo implementation objects
  - ssn -> pmi (used in JDOAdapater#setSession)
    - use subclass technique from c.a.p
    - add attribute map to c.r.p session
    - add static map from ssn object to pmi
  - pc -> sm (could also be used in setSession, but is less important)
    - can use reflection, but that may not be appropriate depending on
      what the spec says regarding the protected-ness of the field

- FCO v SCO
  - how do Collection implementation fit in
  - are PersitenceCapable SCOs using embedded-* the same as components

- integrate pandora/crp collections

- implement alphabet soup in PMFI (setConnectionFactoryName)
  - decide on what APIs to support for the jndi retrieved object
  - see spec for when to use jndi versus when to use jdbc url

- decide if somethine like makeDirty needs to be implemented in c.r.p

- ashah should get cache eviction in c.r.p commitable to PMI#evict can
  be implemented

- add StatementProfiler to engine constructed in PMF

- plan for supporting multithread
  - does it require changes to c.r.p?
