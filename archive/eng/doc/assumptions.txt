* The fully-qualifed class name and object type name of a JDO instance
  have to match.  We rely on this when we write code like this:

    ObjectType type = root.getObjectType(pc.getClass().getName());

* Each JDO instance gets own StateManagerImpl.  We rely on this in
  AbstractStateManager#provideField(PersistenceCapable pc, int field).
  If this were not so, the provideField method would have to be
  synchronized.
