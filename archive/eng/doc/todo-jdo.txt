- Grep through jdo-1_0_1-spec.txt looking for all occurrences of
  "must" in order to compile an exhaustive list of things that we
  _must_ implement.

- stop using PropertyMap as key. switch to serializable String based
  with transient slots for actual thing. add new PMap constructor ?
  another option is to use defined key order and a CompoundKey. might
  want to wait for metamodel changes, which will provide similar
  functionality

- pmi's IdentityMap needs to use weak references to the objects

- First-class Objects vs Second-class Objects
  - how do Collection implementation fit in
  - are PersitenceCapable SCOs using embedded-* the same as components

- integrate pandora/crp collections

- load c.r.p metadata from jdo files instead of pdl files
  - looks like it requires custom enhancer

- implement alphabet soup in PMFI (setConnectionFactoryName)
  - decide on what APIs to support for the jndi retrieved object
  - see spec for when to use jndi versus when to use jdbc url

- decide if something like makeDirty needs to be implemented in c.r.p

- ashah should get cache eviction in c.r.p commitable to PMI#evict can
  be implemented

- serializable query

- add StatementProfiler to engine constructed in PMF

- plan for supporting multithread
  - does it require changes to c.r.p?

- are ascending/descending reserved words in JDO? should the JDOQL
  parser treat them as such?

- proper handling of numeric literals in jdoql

- are a == b == c and a > b > c valid in jdoql

- handling non-short-circuiting boolean operators (& and |) in jdoql

- Performance
  - C.getAllTypes and C.getAllFields should be rewritten such that
    they their (unmodifiable) lists once and only once, as opposed to
    recomputing them on every call.

  - make ReflectionAdapter use cglib's Factory interface for efficient
    object creation
