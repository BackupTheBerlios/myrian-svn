comment on table acs_privileges is '
 The rows in this table correspond to aggregations of specific
 methods. Privileges share a global namespace. This is to avoid a
 situation where granting the foo privilege on one type of object can
 have an entirely different meaning than granting the foo privilege on
 another type of object.
