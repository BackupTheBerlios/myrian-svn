--     In order to work around some optimization issues with MDSQL,
--     we won't bother introducing this foreign key constraint
--     as it introduces circular dependencies between party and 
--     party_email_map.
--
-- alter table parties add constraint parties_primary_email_fk 
--   foreign key (party_id, primary_email) 
--       references party_email_map (party_id, email_address);
