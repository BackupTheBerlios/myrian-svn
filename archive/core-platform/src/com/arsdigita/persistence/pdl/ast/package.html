<b><font color="red">Experimental</font></b> These classes are used as
part of the implementation of the PDL package ("AST" stands for
"Abstract Syntax Tree"). Therefore, they do not constitute a public
API that is guaranteed not to change, which is why the package is
marked "experimental" even though its contents are known to be
stable. (We may want a different stability level for this type of
package.)
