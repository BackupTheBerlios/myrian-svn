  <li>We currently generate an extraneous outer join when using the
      query generator to fetch associations.</li>
  <li>There are extraneous joins for fetching aggressively loaded two

      SQL since the code in this package isn't quite fast enough to
      run all the time without a noticable lag.</li>
