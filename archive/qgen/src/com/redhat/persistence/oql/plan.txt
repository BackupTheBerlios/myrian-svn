 * Write prototype data structures and analyzer code in order to
   demonstrate the feasability of deriving the necessary information
   to optimize the given queries.

 * Enumerate test queries for prototype code based at a minimum on all
   the different situations in which persistence uses the query
   interface for navigating data structures.

 * Qualias support.

 * Final oql data structures and analyzer. (Prototype + Current
   Analyzer = 1.5KLOC)

 * Write dumb sql generation, i.e. sql generation that does not take
   advantage of the analyzer. (Current QGen + Analyzer = 1KLOC)

 * Modify persistence to use new query data structures. At this point
   we should have a fully running end to end system.
   (Session.getQuery() + QuerySource impls = 0.5KLOC)

 * Modify sql generation code to produce more optimized sql based on
   the analyzed query.
